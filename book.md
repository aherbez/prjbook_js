# Intro

Hello! And a very warm welcome to you, whoever you are. My hope is that this book will help you on your journey to learn how to create beautiful, interesting, useful things with code.

This book is meant to address a certain gap that I've seen- there are a ton of resources to learn how to code, but it can be hard when you're first starting out, to know what to code. This isn't unqiue to code- it's a common problem with any complex, worthwhile skill - there's a space between learning the basics and becoming truly self-directed where one knows a little, but wonders a lot.

In those moments, it can seem overwhelming...

"I can cut wood, but how do I make furniture?"
"I can blink an LED, but how to I make a robot?"
"I can play scales, but how do I make music?"
...and so on.

All those basics are important, but it takes some time to know how to apply them to novel situations. And there's no easy way to bridge that gap. This book represents my best attempt to help you across the divide.

The key thing is that you're the only one that can do it for you. So rather than walking you through step by step, this book poses some options, then asks you some questions. To get the most out of it, you'll need to do the work yourself. What that means will vary from person to person. It will almost certainly involve some sketching and quality time with pen and paper. You will likely stare off into space for extended periods. If you have a pet, stroking their fur will provide valuable insights. Likewise your favorite hot beverage, or going for a walk in a place you care about. Give yourself space to think, expose yourself to beauty, and let it take the time it takes.

You can do this.

I believe in you.

Let's begin.

## Specifics

In this book, we'll be making some things with code. But that could mean any number of things, and to make a thing, one must be specific. So in this particular book, we'll be using vanilla HTML, Javascript, and the <canvas> tag. There are a few reasons for those particular choices- all of them can be used in a very minimal way, yet expands into a universe of useful and interesting skills. While any actual, production-ready application is unlikely to use this particular stack, they are highly likely to build from these particular building blocks. Knowing the fundamentals is always worthwhile.

The following is an overview and introduction to the tech we'll be using. Feel free to skip it if you're already familiar.

### Terms

Okay, so what are we using, really? The simple answer is HTML and javascript, just like everything else on the web. But what are those things? 

#### HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the lingua franca of the web. It provides the skeleton of every site you've ever visited. At its heart, it's a simple format based around annotating text with metadata. It's as old as the web itself, so reflects what we thought the web was for in the beginning, namely sharing text, maybe some images, and connecting things to each other. Since then it's been expanded in all sorts of ways, but at its core its about providing a way to turn a text file into something more interesting (and more easily sharable) by
