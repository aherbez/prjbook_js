# Book structure

Three parts:
- basic overview of the main tools you'll need to do the projects
- a list of projects. Each one has a description, and an indication of the first hint
- a list of hints
    this is the bulk of the book. Each hint provides a clue as to what to do next
    a given clue may appear in the path of clues for multiple projects
    clues are broken up into related groupings based on the type of step (math, input, etc)
    each hint takes the form of Socratic dialog indicating something that should be considered
    maybe have a corresponding entry with the answer to the hint?
    the last hint in a given sequence leads to a github repo with an example solution
